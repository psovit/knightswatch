# knightswatch

 Problem:
 A knight piece is on an infinite chess board. 
 Assuming the knight is positioned at (0,0) you are asked to calculate and print the shortest path 
 that the knight can take to get to the target location.

 A console application in C# is built to solve this problem.
 
 Thanks!
